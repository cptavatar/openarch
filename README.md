# openarch
Configs for my openbox/arch vm I use for dev

What I'm doing...
- check out this project to ~/.openarch
- create ~/.openarch-aur to download aur packages
- basic configuration is handled under openarch/conf, copied to ~/ .dotfiles style
- keep track of what is installed under .openarch/setup so I can rebuild without too much effort if desired, rollback if I screw things up, or fork off and use elsewhere.
